This project aims to analyze and compare the out-of-sample performance of a mean-variance optimization model, which uses historical data to estimate input parameters. We will evaluate this model against a naive portfolio strategy that equally weights all available assets. The analysis includes selecting a suitable data set, choosing estimation windows for calculating mean returns and covariances, and conducting portfolio optimizations. By examining these strategies over different time horizons, we seek to gain insights into their effectiveness under varying market conditions.
